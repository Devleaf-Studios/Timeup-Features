# Timeup issues/Features
Welcome to the public issue/feedback tracker for Timeup; Social Media. This page might not be the one you are looking for, to see what new things are coming to Timeup soon, visit our [Project Board here](https://github.com/Devleaf-Studios/Timeup-Features/projects/1). 

## Getting involved with development of Timeup.
We're always thankful to people who want to join Timeup to test out the latest and greatest features early. As a tester you will be able to access Timeup early, play with new features and help us create a better app. 

Whilst we always love you getting involved, we have a strict number of places available in our Alpha/Beta access queue. If you would like to become a tester yourself please get in touch with us including your **name, age and email address associated with your Apple ID or Google Play account (we'll need these to add you to our beta team on the associated platform)**.

Testers must understand that the app will be in a "degraded state" when testing, and as such things might not work completely as expected. We want to hear all feedback about any problems you may be facing in the app or features you think would make timeup even better. Get in touch using [Our Issues](https://github.com/Devleaf-Studios/Timeup-Features/issues) if you have a GitHub account, or you can use our [Form](#) to fill out if you don't; and one of our team will open an issue on your behalf if we deem it relevant.

Please note that our standard privacy policy does not apply to the testing program, as we may need to view more information than usual to investigate problems or add new features. We will try our best to adhere to our privacy policy where possible but please take this into account before signing up to our beta program.
